1) In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data.   Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).     
2) The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League.  The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.    
3) Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?

Question 3:
After reviewing the two files given for this exercise they seemed to be very distinct problems to solve. 
However, after finally completing the weatherData.py file, I was able to notice a pattern with the soccerData.py file.
Both files needed imports, both needed to open a file to report their data. They needed structure on whitespaces
and conditional statements instructing it on how to apply data onto the .dat files. The way I wrote my weaterData.py file
definitely influenced how the soccerData.py file was written.
